# Starter Project

This is a starter project template using Vite, React, and various other libraries. It is designed for quick development and includes essential tools for building modern web applications.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast development server and build tool.
- **Framer Motion**: For animations and transitions.
- **React Toastify**: For notifications and alerts.
- **Sass**: A preprocessor for CSS to enable nested rules and variables.
- **ESLint**: A linting tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd starter
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start Vite's development server, and you can view your application in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized static files for your application in the `dist` folder.

### Linting

To lint your code, you can run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This will check your code for any linting errors based on the rules specified in your ESLint configuration.

### Previewing the Build

To preview the production build, run:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will start a local server to serve the production build files.
